# PKP cursors for Mousecape
All art credit goes to [@O__dAng on X](https://x.com/O__dAng/status/1876803680571187625).

To use these, download [Mousecape](https://github.com/alexzielenski/Mousecape) and open the .cape file with it.

For convenience I've included folders for each mouse cursor that have the individual frames of the animation in .png form, the Mousecape vertically-stacked-frames format, and the original .ani file.
